# GTTrackerAndroid
Android Module Of GTTracker Project

##Introduction
The app is based on Android Operating system and we have compiled it with latest Android OS 5.1. Android is a mobile operating system (OS) based on the Linux kernel and currently developed by Google. With a user interface based on direct manipulation, Android is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, with specialized user interfaces for televisions (Android TV), cars (Android Auto), and wrist watches (Android Wear). The OS uses touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, and a virtual keyboard. Despite being primarily designed for touchscreen input, it has also been used in game consoles, digital cameras, regular PCs, and other electronics.  We have also embed the Google MAPS API for Android. Following are the Google APIs and Android APIs are used in the android APP
a.	Google Cloud Messaging

b.	Google Maps V3 API

c.	Google Geolocation API

d.	Android Location Sensors API
